research.VOIDSEER_GOGGLES.stage.1=Lately, a hint of dissapointment has struck me concerning my Goggles of Revealing. After creating the Voidseer's Pearl, I felt as if I could perhaps truly see more than I can with the current incarnation of the goggles.
research.VOIDSEER_GOGGLES.stage.2=With a bit of time and effort, a new invention has sprung before me. Born of the shadowy Voidseer's Pearl, and Void Metal infused lenses, these new goggles not only fit my new attire, but also have a new feature to go with them. When wearing these new goggles, I can see the state of the aura around me at all times, and feel it's changes to an almost... numerical point.
